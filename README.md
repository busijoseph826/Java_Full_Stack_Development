# Java Full Stack Development Learning Path

This repository documents my journey in learning Java Full Stack Development. Below is the roadmap of topics I aim to cover, with updates as I complete each one.

## Learning Roadmap

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Core Java</strong></summary>
  <details>
    <summary><strong>What is Java?</strong></summary>
    Java is a technology by which we can develop Web-based Applications, Console-based Applications, Standalone Applications, and Enterprise Applications, etc.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Features of Java</strong></summary>
    In this section, we will discuss the top features of Java:

    1. **Simple**
       - Java is a simple programming language because of two reasons:
         1. Generic API
         2. Byte Code

    2. **Platform Independent**
       - Java is a platform-independent programming language because whenever we create a Java file and compile it on any OS, we get a `.class` file. If we copy this `.class` into another OS, we will still be able to run and execute the program without any interruption. Java satisfies "Write once, run anywhere."
       - Byte code is platform-independent, but JVM is not.

    3. **Architectural Neutral**
       - Java software will run on every processor.

    4. **Portable**
       - Java is a portable language because it satisfies both platform-independent and Architectural Neutral features.

    5. **Dynamic**
       - Java is a dynamic programming language because of the collection framework.

    6. **Distributed**
       - Java is a distributed programming language because of its ability to develop applications that can run on both servers and browsers.

    7. **Network**
       - Java is a network programming language because of its ability to develop applications that can connect systems like Client-Server, Client-Multiple Servers, Server-Database, and Multiple Server-Database using a network as a communication layer.

    8. **Multi-Threading**
       - Java is a multi-threading programming language because every program has two threads in common:
         1. Foreground Thread
         2. Background Thread

    9. **High Performance**
       - Java is high-performance because of two reasons:
         1. Byte Code
         2. Garbage Collector

    10. **Highly Interpreted**
        - Java is highly interpreted because of both JVM and JIT compiler.

    11. **Robust**
        - Java is robust because of the presence of exceptional handling techniques, which can be handled using keywords like `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`.

    12. **Secured**
        - Java is secured because whenever we transfer data from client to server through the network, the data is transformed into an encrypted format.

    13. **Object-Oriented Programming**
        - Java is an OOP-based language because it satisfies the four pillars of OOPs:
          1. Inheritance
          2. Abstraction
          3. Encapsulation
          4. Polymorphism
